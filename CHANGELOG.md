# Changelog

## [w0-foundation] 2026-09-30
- Scaffold: Vite 8, React 19.3, TypeScript 6.0 (strict), ESLint 10 and typescript-eslint 8 (zero warnings), Vitest 5 with happy-dom and fake-indexeddb, Playwright 1.63 (WebKit 390, Chromium 412, desktop 1440), vite-plugin-pwa (generateSW, prompt; runtime caching for OpenFreeMap and Photon). Every dependency is pinned and the lockfile is committed.
- Hash router with every route pre-registered and lazy-loaded; shell with the mobile tab bar, desktop header, N/M/J// shortcuts, global and per-route error boundary, toast host, offline banner and Demo badge; first-launch redirect to `#/welcome`.
- Data layer: typed domain model, namespaced IndexedDB (`demo`/`live`), reactive store with an outbox on every write, LWW merge and soft delete/undo, a minimal sync engine (backoff, online/offline), a demo adapter backed by its own IDB, and a seed of 11 Photon-geocoded hotels and 12 visits covering glide, hop and flight legs.
- The private letter is served through `virtual:private-letter` (build-time only; `null` in CI), and `tools/check-private.mjs` guards against leaks.
- Core components: SplitFlap, BottomSheet, Button, Chip/ChipGroup, Badge, TimestampChip, Toast, Skeleton, ClockLoader, EmptyState, ErrorState, OfflineBanner, Stamp, DemoBadge, StayCard, StayArt, and provisional icons. `#/gallery` shows them all.
- Lib: dates, geo, geocode (Photon), ulid, stats, motion, haptics, sound, busy, toast and useMediaQuery, all unit-tested (191 Vitest tests in total).
- Stays v1 (hero, split-flap counter, stats, city tabs, search, card grid) and working stubs for every other route.
- CI: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys to GitHub Pages and copies `404.html`; `npm run size` checks the initial JS (128.1 KB gzipped).
## [w0-design] Phase 0: design

- Measured dayuse.ae tokens (CSS bundles + computed styles); `design/tokens.md`, `src/styles/tokens.css` with WCAG AA table.
- Self-hosted Manrope + JetBrains Mono (`public/fonts/`, `src/styles/fonts.css`).
- Key-tag mark (`KeyTagMark`, full/mono/outline), favicon, PWA icons (any, maskable, monochrome), apple-touch icon, 12 iOS splash screens (`design/icons.md`).
- Ink-outline icon set (55 icons), mood stamps (8), map pin SVGs (stay, wishlist, home, cluster).
- Design plan with wireframes for every screen + critique (`design/plan.md`), copy deck (`design/copy.md`).
- Static clickable prototype (`design/prototype/`) and Checkpoint 1 artifacts (`design/checkpoints/cp1/`).

## w1-shell
- Intro: a lazy Three.js first-launch scene (toon-shaded door, card reader and the 619 key tag on its ring, with ink edge lines). The card taps the lock, the light goes green and the door opens. There's a 2D SVG/CSS fallback for reduced motion, low-end devices and slow chunk loads, and a 400 ms version on later launches. Tap or any key skips.
- Onboarding: Who's checking in → Connect (Try demo or ConnectionForm; skipped after an invite) → Home base (mini map plus a Photon city picker) → Install (Android prompt, iOS illustrated steps, Maybe later) → Check-in complete.
- The letter: "A note on your pillow" slides in on the reader's first launch, lifts and flips in CSS 3D, and reveals line by line with a mask sweep. It's signed, with "Written in Dubai, September 2026" beneath. The markdown is rendered safely and `read_at` is written on open. Nirsh gets a one-time "Shady read your note" toast. The Letters list shows sealed envelopes with hints, and "Write a future note" saves through `upsertLetter`.
- Settings, export/import, PWA manifest, service worker and install wiring (see the helper commits).
